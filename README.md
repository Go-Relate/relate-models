# Relate Models

This repository contains the foundational execution models behind Relate.

These models formalize how progress breaks down before work meaningfully begins. They expose the hidden mechanics through which decision friction, attention fragmentation, misalignment, and inconsistency compound into stalled outcomes.

This repository is not a product.  
It is a source of truth.

## What This Repository Is

- A canonical record of Relate’s execution models
- A place where assumptions are explicit and defensible
- A reference for how invisible friction becomes observable loss
- The logical foundation beneath Relate’s public tools

Each model is designed to reveal patterns, not prescribe behavior.

---

## What This Repository Is Not

This repository does not:
- Teach productivity
- Offer advice or next steps
- Optimize routines or schedules
- Contain UI or frontend implementations
- Act as a coaching or self improvement system

The goal is clarity, not comfort.

---

## Model Design Principles

All models in this repository adhere to the same principles:

- Conservative assumptions over dramatic claims
- Deterministic logic with no ambiguity
- Fixed constants to prevent manipulation
- Independent dimensions to avoid overlap
- No personalization, comparison, or scoring
- Recognition over persuasion

If a model motivates, it fails.  
If it reveals, it succeeds.

## Models

### Execution Debt

Quantifies how delayed execution compounds into lost outcomes.

This model converts postponed tasks, decision delay, context switching, and rework into measurable execution loss. It establishes a lower bound on damage without exaggeration.

---

### Founder Reality Check

Surfaces execution truth through binary commitment.

This model collapses rationalization by mapping clarity, alignment, and capacity into a single diagnostic state. It removes ambiguity without offering resolution.

---

### Momentum Flow Field

Models execution as a dynamic flow system.

This model separates effort from movement by visualizing how focus, consistency, switching, and overthinking interact to create alignment, turbulence, or backflow.

---

### Focus Fracture Heat Map

Visualizes how attention is fragmented across a workday.

This model shows how switching and interruptions break continuity, revealing why long days often fail to compound into meaningful progress.

---

## Intended Audience

This repository is written for:
- Builders
- Founders
- Operators
- Researchers
- Thinkers

It assumes the reader values structure over reassurance and truth over tactics.

---

## Relationship to Relate

The models in this repository are used by Relate’s public tools and experiments, but the repository itself is not the product.

Relate tools translate these models into experience.  
This repository documents the logic behind that translation.

---

## Contribution Philosophy

Contributions are welcome only if they improve clarity or correctness.

- Complexity without necessity is rejected
- Additions without a distinct pattern are declined
- Changes that soften conclusions are refused

Refer to CONTRIBUTING.md before submitting changes.

## Final Note

Relate does not attempt to motivate action.

It exposes the cost of avoiding it.

This repository exists to make that cost legible.

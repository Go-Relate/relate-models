# <relate-models>

This repository is part of Relate.

It contains tools, puzzles, or systems designed to expose how people think, decide, and act, and why momentum often breaks despite effort.

## Purpose

This project exists to make a specific pattern visible. It does not attempt to motivate, optimize, or persuade. It reveals structure and behavior through logic and design.

## Usage

Instructions are intentionally minimal. If something requires excessive explanation, it likely does not belong here.

## Philosophy

Relate focuses on clarity over comfort. Understanding precedes action, but only action creates change.

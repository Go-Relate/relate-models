# Contributing

Relate values clarity over cleverness and simplicity over complexity.

Contributions are welcome only if they align with the purpose of the project. This is not a feature request board and not a place for speculative additions.

Before contributing, ensure that your change:
- Preserves simplicity
- Improves clarity
- Does not add unnecessary abstraction
- Aligns with the intent of the project

Pull requests that add complexity without clear benefit will be declined.

Discussion is encouraged. Noise is not.

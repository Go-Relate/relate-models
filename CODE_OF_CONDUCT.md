# Code of Conduct

Relate exists to explore ideas, systems, and tools with clarity and intent.

We expect all participants to engage in good faith, communicate clearly, and respect differing viewpoints. Disagreement is acceptable. Disrespect is not.

## Expected Behavior

- Be thoughtful and precise in communication
- Critique ideas, not people
- Keep discussions focused on the work
- Assume good intent unless proven otherwise

## Unacceptable Behavior

- Harassment or personal attacks
- Dismissive or hostile communication
- Repeated off topic or low effort contributions
- Any behavior that disrupts constructive discussion

## Enforcement

Maintainers may remove content or restrict participation that violates this code. Decisions are made to protect clarity and integrity, not to punish.

## Scope

This code applies to all repositories, issues, discussions, and pull requests within the Relate organization.
